Column Name				Explanation		
Scientific Name				scientific name, binomial nomenclature + cultivar in single quotation marks when provided
Family					scientific family name
Genus					scientific genus name
Species					scientific species name
Cultivar				scientific cultivar name
Common Name				common/colloquial name in English
Photosynthetic Pathway			photosynthetic pathway (e.g. C3/C4)
tissue					tissue type sampled for analysis (if multiple tissues were sampled, only the most commonly eaten one is included in the database)
Study Type				experimental method (FACE, OTC, chamber, greenhouse, tunnel)
Plot Type				experimental planting method (field or pot)
Elevated CO2				experimental elevated CO2 level	in ppm
Ambient CO2				experimental ambient CO2 level in ppm. Unreported values were determined using the Keeling Curve
Added CO2				added CO2 level in ppm (=eco2-aco2)
Additional Info				co-factors not otherwise categorized, or used to differentiate between datasets in the same report
Elevated temperature			details on temperature if used as an experimental factor.
						Single numbers are the amount added to ambient. Numbers separated by a slash are day/night temperature, 
						given only if multiple temperature regimes are used. All numbers given in degrees Celsius.	
Irrigation				details on irrigation if used as an experimental factor	
Sowing Time				details on sowing time if used as an experimental factor. TOS='time of sowing'
Phosphorous application			details on phosphorous application if used as an experimental factor
Nitrogen application			details on nitrogen application if used as an experimental factor
Ozone					details on ozone application if used as an experimental factor
Year					year(s) experiment was conducted
Latitude				latitude of experimental locations for outdoor (FACE, OTC) experiments in decimal degrees
						When unavailable, the nearest relevant research facility is used.
Longitude				longitude of experimental locations for outdoor (FACE, OTC) experiments in decimal degrees
						When unavailable, the nearest relevant research facility is used.
Country					country location used in OTC and FACE studies, since they are conducted outdoors
Reference				short citation of the data source
						full citations are given in 'CO2_Rise_Crop_Quality_SI_Data Sources.csv'
n						number of paired observations or replicas used to calculate the mean percentage change (delta) and natural log response (ln r)
element					nutrient analyzed (chemical element, protein, or phytate given as 'Phyt')
delta					mean percentage change of the element in the sample
ln r					natural log response ratio
Origin					who made us aware of the data. 'Loladze', 'Myers', 'Dietterich' is for references obtained via Loladze (2014), 
						Myers et al. (2014), and Dietterich et al. (2015) respectively. 'Fernando' refers to the work from N. Fernando 
						in 2012 and 2014, which were used in Dietterich et al. (2015). We elected to pull the data directly from her published work. See:
