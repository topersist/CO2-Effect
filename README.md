This repository includes the files created and used in 'CO2 Rise Directly Impairs Crop Nutritional Quality' published by Global Change Biology.
The data and code that support the findings of this study are openly available in Zenodo at http://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.17274164.
To cite this work, please use the DOI of the Zenodo deposit.
Three additional files are uploaded as Supplementary Information and are not included here. They are:

* 'Data Sources' (pdf), which contains the full citation and DOI of the articles used to create the database (File 3)
* 'Supplementary Figures' (pdf) created by the python code (File 1).
* 'Appendix S2'  (pdf), which explains how existing databases were used in the creation of File 3 to avoid double-counting.
  They are also available upon reasonable individual request.



The included files here are:
* File 1: CO2\_Rise\_Crop\_Quality\_SI\_Code.py
* File 2: CO2\_Rise\_Crop\_Quality\_SI\_Code spec-file.txt
* File 3: CO2\_Rise\_Crop\_Quality\_SI\_Data\_S1\_Database.csv
* File 4: CO2\_Rise\_Crop\_Quality\_SI\_Data\_S2\_Database\_Read Me.txt
* File 5: CO2\_Rise\_Crop\_Quality\_SI\_Data\_S3\_Results\_for publication.csv
* File 6: CO2\_Rise\_Crop\_Quality\_SI\_Data\_S4\_Results\_Read Me.txt




They relate to each other as follows:
File 1 is the Python code used to analyze the input database (File 3). It automatically produces all the figures and outputs to the console the numbers used in the manuscript. This code is maintained by 'topersist' on GitHub.
Consult File 2 to clone the environment used when creating the script (File 1).
File 3 is the input database and is associated with its readme (File 4), which explains the variable names and units.
File 5 is the output of File 1 when run using File 3, and contains the results as used in the final figures for publication.
File 6 is the associated readme, which explains the variable names and units.
